# Google Authentication Configuration

## Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID Setup

To enable Google authentication in this CMS, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Google API project**:
   - Go to [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Navigate to "Credentials" section

2. **Configure OAuth consent screen**:
   - Set application name, authorized domains, etc.
   - Save the settings

3. **Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID**:
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
   - Select "Web application" as application type
   - Add your domain to "Authorized JavaScript origins"
   - Add your callback URL to "Authorized redirect URIs" (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/signin-google)
   - Click "Create"

4. **Get your Client ID and Secret**:
   - After creation, Google will display your Client ID and Client Secret
   - Copy these values

5. **Update application settings**:
   - Open `appsettings.json` (and `appsettings.Production.json` for production)
   - Update the "Authentication:Google" section:
   ```json
   "Authentication": {
     "Google": {
       "ClientId": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID",
       "ClientSecret": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET"
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Restart the application**:
   - The Google sign-in button should now work properly

## Security Considerations

- Never commit your Client Secret to source control
- For production, use environment variables or secret manager
- Ensure you validate email addresses from Google authentication
- Consider implementing multi-factor authentication for additional security

## Testing

To test the Google authentication integration:
1. Start the application
2. Go to the Login or Register page
3. Click the "Google ile Giri≈ü Yap" button
4. You should be redirected to Google's authentication page
5. After authentication, you'll be redirected back to the application
